//This Indicator is mainly made up of 3 parts:

Weighted EMA: This indicator is represented by the EMA defualt length of 14 and color.blue. It takes the moving average of the price and volume to represent the median price for a giv en time frame. If candlesticks have crossed above the blue EMA line this is the first indicater of an up trend. Conversly, the same applies if the candlesticks have crossed bellow the blue line.the wieghted configuration allows for a more accurate averaging to maintain live market data.

Next, we have the EMA halftrend/Halftrend Prediction: This is represented as the circles that appear on the chart. The circles are based of the median of the first EMA and a "halftrend" model, meaning  that it also takes into account the average of trend directio+time+Ema\x= position of the circles. The circles will defualt set to yellow however the other part of this is that this feature also predicts change in trend direction. If trend directio+time+Ema\x= position is >previous on average the circle will turn red for down and green for up. When the sgnal is strong enough an arrow will accompany the circle above or bellow.
